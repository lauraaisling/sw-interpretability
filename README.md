<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Breaking down the model into interpretable units allows us to better understand how models store representations. However, the occurrence of polysemantic neurons, or neurons that respond to multiple unrelated features, makes interpreting individual neurons challenging. This has led to the search for meaningful directions, known as concept vectors, in activation space instead of looking at individual neurons. 
We demonstrate our method to disentangle polysemantic neurons into concept vectors consisting of linear combinations of neurons that encapsulate distinct features.
